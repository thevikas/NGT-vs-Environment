# NGT-vs-Environment

The primary case is about its order to ban 15 year old petrol and 10 yo diesel vehicles.
This order was to cleanup the air of New Delhi.
There was no way to verify if pollution was only from old vehicular.
And to assume a group of illegal pollution because few members of a group cause more pollution is wrong.
There are many aspects to consider why the order for the ban is wrong. And the result of this ban is completely opposite and many times much worse to its intended outcome.

1. It does not consider the different types of pollution.
2. It does not consider the pollution outside NCR Delhi.
3. It does not consider the pollution from industries.
4. It does not consider the non-implementation of environment laws.
5. It does not consider that every type vehicle is different.
6. It does not consider policies in place around the world
7. It does not consider environment impact of mining
8. It does not consider environment impact of a manufacturing unit
9. It does not consider toxicity of refinery plants
